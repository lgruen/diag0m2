*Abstract:* The quality parameter t of (t,m,s)-nets controls extensive stratification
properties of the generated sample points. However, the definition allows for points
that are arbitrarily close across strata boundaries.  We continue the investigation of
(t,m,s)-nets under the constraint of maximizing the mutual distance of the points on the
unit torus and present two new constructions along with algorithms. The first approach
is based on the fact that reordering (t,s)-sequences can result in (t,m,s+1)-nets with
varying toroidal distance, while the second algorithm generates points by permutations
instead of matrices.
